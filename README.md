my hyprland config ^_^


## Design Philosophy

I like to do things in chunks rather than memorize every single keybinding since I'd rather focus my energy on sensible yet effective defaults that get shit done and are transferable to other places, and offload that cognitive overhead somewhere else more worthy of it. I'm not like you vim lunatics; I'm a different breed :100: fr fr. That's not to say I don't like to diverge, it's just consistency and ensuring that it stays in my brain. Same reason I don't like using ORMs when doing web dev.

The result? Using these keybindings is like executing combos in a fighting game. It's designed like a game intentionally to keep me engaged (locked in).

Alt+F5 = Track stuff: next/prev/pause/play (→/←/space/space)
Alt+F6 = Volume stuff: up/down/mute/unmute (↑/↓/space/space)
Alt+Shift+F6 = Mic Stuff: mute/unmute (space/space)
Alt+F7 = Brightness stuff: up/down (↑/↓)
F8 = OCR stuff
F9 = Screenshot stuff
F10 = Video stuff
